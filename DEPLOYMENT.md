  - Mobile responsiveness

### 3.3 Common Issues & Solutions

**Build Fails:**
- Check Node.js version compatibility
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify build command is correct

**App Doesn't Load:**
- Check if it's a React Router issue
- Verify start command is correct
- Check browser console for errors

**Static Assets Not Loading:**
- Ensure favicon.svg is in public folder
